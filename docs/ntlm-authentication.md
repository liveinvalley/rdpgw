# NTLM Authentication

RDPGW supports NTLM authentication for simple setup with Windows clients. Credentials can be verified in two ways:

- **File backend** (default): users and passwords are listed in the `rdpgw-auth` configuration file. Useful for small deployments with a limited number of users.
- **Winbind backend**: the NTLM handshake is delegated to Samba's `ntlm_auth` helper, and a Microsoft Active Directory domain controller verifies the credentials. No passwords are stored on the gateway. See [Active Directory Authentication via Winbind](#active-directory-authentication-via-winbind).

Both backends work with clients that are not joined to the domain.

## Advantages

- **Easy Setup**: Simple configuration without external dependencies
- **Windows Client Support**: Works with default Windows client `mstsc`
- **No External Services**: Self-contained authentication mechanism
- **Quick Deployment**: Ideal for small teams or testing environments
- **Active Directory Integration**: With the winbind backend, domain accounts, password policies, lockouts and group membership are enforced by the domain controller

## Security Warning

**⚠️ Plain Text Storage (file backend)**: With the file backend, passwords are stored in plain text to support the NTLM authentication protocol. Keep configuration files secure and avoid reusing passwords for other applications. The winbind backend does not store any passwords.

## Configuration

### 1. Gateway Configuration

Configure RDPGW to use NTLM authentication:

```yaml
Server:
  Authentication:
    - ntlm
Caps:
  TokenAuth: false
```

### 2. Authentication Helper Configuration

Create configuration file for `rdpgw-auth` with user credentials:

```yaml
# /etc/rdpgw-auth.yaml
Users:
  - Username: "alice"
    Password: "secure_password_1"
  - Username: "bob"
    Password: "secure_password_2"
  - Username: "admin"
    Password: "admin_secure_password"
```

### 3. Start Authentication Helper

Run the `rdpgw-auth` helper with NTLM configuration:

```bash
./rdpgw-auth -c /etc/rdpgw-auth.yaml -s /tmp/rdpgw-auth.sock
```

## Active Directory Authentication via Winbind

With `Ntlm.Backend: winbind`, `rdpgw-auth` does not verify NTLM messages itself.
For every handshake it starts Samba's `ntlm_auth` helper in
`--helper-protocol=squid-2.5-ntlmssp` mode and relays the NTLM messages to it.
`ntlm_auth` asks `winbindd`, which forwards the authentication to a domain
controller (NTLM pass-through authentication over Netlogon). The gateway never
learns the user's password or NT hash.

NTLM is a challenge/response protocol, so the password never reaches the gateway.
That is why an LDAP bind cannot be used to verify NTLM logons, and why the
gateway host has to be a member of the domain.

### Prerequisites

1. Install Samba's winbind and client tools, e.g. on Debian/Ubuntu:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install winbind samba-common-bin krb5-user
   ```

2. Configure `/etc/samba/smb.conf` as a domain member. A minimal example:

   ```ini
   [global]
       security = ads
       realm = EXAMPLE.COM
       workgroup = EXAMPLE
       winbind use default domain = yes
       winbind separator = \
       idmap config * : backend = tdb
       idmap config * : range = 3000-7999
       idmap config EXAMPLE : backend = rid
       idmap config EXAMPLE : range = 10000-999999
   ```

3. Join the domain and start winbind:

   ```bash
   sudo net ads join -U Administrator
   sudo systemctl enable --now winbind
   ```

4. Verify the setup:

   ```bash
   # Trust secret between this host and the domain is valid
   wbinfo -t
   # A domain account can be verified through ntlm_auth
   ntlm_auth --username=alice --password='secret'
   ```

5. Allow the `rdpgw-auth` user to use winbind's privileged pipe. `ntlm_auth` needs
   access to `/var/lib/samba/winbindd_privileged`, which is owned by a dedicated
   group (`winbindd_priv` on Debian/Ubuntu):

   ```bash
   sudo usermod -aG winbindd_priv rdpgw
   ```

### Helper Configuration

```yaml
# /etc/rdpgw-auth.yaml
Ntlm:
  Backend: winbind
  Winbind:
    NtlmAuthPath: /usr/bin/ntlm_auth
    Domain: EXAMPLE
    RequireMembershipOf: "EXAMPLE\\RDP Users"
    Timeout: 10
    StripDomain: false
    Separator: "\\"
```

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `Ntlm.Backend` | `file` | `file` verifies against the `Users` list, `winbind` delegates to `ntlm_auth`. |
| `Ntlm.Winbind.NtlmAuthPath` | `/usr/bin/ntlm_auth` | Path of the `ntlm_auth` binary. It must exist at startup. |
| `Ntlm.Winbind.Domain` | empty | Passed as `--domain`. Leave empty to use winbind's own domain. |
| `Ntlm.Winbind.RequireMembershipOf` | empty | Passed as `--require-membership-of`. A group name (`DOMAIN\Group`) or SID. Only members of that group can log on. |
| `Ntlm.Winbind.Timeout` | `10` | Seconds to wait for each reply from `ntlm_auth`. Must be positive. |
| `Ntlm.Winbind.StripDomain` | `false` | When `true`, the user name passed to the gateway is `alice` instead of `EXAMPLE\alice`. |
| `Ntlm.Winbind.Separator` | `\` | The `winbind separator` from `smb.conf`, used by `StripDomain`. |

The `Users` list is ignored with the winbind backend; `rdpgw-auth` logs a warning
when it is present.

### Restricting Access to a Group

Without `RequireMembershipOf`, every enabled domain account can authenticate to the
gateway. To limit access, create a group such as `RDP Users` in Active Directory and
set `RequireMembershipOf: "EXAMPLE\\RDP Users"` (or the group's SID). Users outside
the group are rejected by `ntlm_auth` with `NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED`.

### User Names

`ntlm_auth` reports authenticated users as `DOMAIN<separator>user`, for example
`EXAMPLE\alice`. This is the name rdpgw uses for host selection and in its logs.
Enable `StripDomain` if your `Server.Hosts` templates or downstream systems expect
the bare account name.

Users enter their domain credentials in the client, e.g. `EXAMPLE\alice` or
`alice@example.com`. The client itself does not need to be joined to the domain.

### Limitations

- The gateway host must be joined to the domain and run `winbindd`.
- The distroless container image cannot run this backend because it ships no Samba.
  Use the Alpine based image described in `dev/docker/docker-readme.md`, or run
  `rdpgw-auth` directly on a domain-joined host.
- Only raw NTLMSSP messages are supported. SPNEGO-wrapped `Negotiate` tokens
  (Kerberos) are not handled by this backend; use the
  [Kerberos authentication](kerberos-authentication.md) mode for that.

## Authentication Flow

1. Client initiates NTLM handshake with gateway
2. Gateway forwards NTLM messages to `rdpgw-auth`
3. Helper validates credentials against the configured user list (file backend), or relays the handshake to `ntlm_auth`, which asks a domain controller (winbind backend)
4. Client connects directly on successful authentication

## User Management

This section applies to the file backend. With the winbind backend, users and
passwords are managed in Active Directory.

### Adding Users

Edit the configuration file and restart the helper:

```yaml
Users:
  - Username: "newuser"
    Password: "new_secure_password"
  - Username: "existing_user"
    Password: "existing_password"
```

### Password Rotation

1. Update passwords in configuration file
2. Restart `rdpgw-auth` helper
3. Notify users of password changes

### User Removal

Remove user entries from configuration and restart helper.

## Deployment Options

### Systemd Service

Create `/etc/systemd/system/rdpgw-auth.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=RDPGW NTLM Authentication Helper
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=rdpgw
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/rdpgw-auth -c /etc/rdpgw-auth.yaml -s /tmp/rdpgw-auth.sock
Restart=always
RestartSec=5

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

With the winbind backend, start the helper after winbind and grant access to the
privileged pipe:

```ini
[Unit]
After=network.target winbind.service
Wants=winbind.service

[Service]
SupplementaryGroups=winbindd_priv
```

### Docker Deployment

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  rdpgw-auth:
    image: rdpgw-auth
    volumes:
      - ./rdpgw-auth.yaml:/etc/rdpgw-auth.yaml:ro
      - auth-socket:/tmp
    restart: always

  rdpgw:
    image: rdpgw
    volumes:
      - auth-socket:/tmp
    depends_on:
      - rdpgw-auth

volumes:
  auth-socket:
```

### Kubernetes Deployment

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: rdpgw-auth-config
data:
  rdpgw-auth.yaml: |
    Users:
      - Username: "user1"
        Password: "password1"
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: rdpgw-auth
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: rdpgw-auth
        image: rdpgw-auth
        volumeMounts:
        - name: config
          mountPath: /etc/rdpgw-auth.yaml
          subPath: rdpgw-auth.yaml
      volumes:
      - name: config
        configMap:
          name: rdpgw-auth-config
```

## Client Configuration

### Windows (mstsc)

NTLM authentication works seamlessly with the default Windows Remote Desktop client:

1. Configure gateway address in RDP settings
2. Save gateway credentials when prompted
3. Connect using domain credentials or local accounts

### Alternative Clients

NTLM is widely supported across RDP clients:

- **mRemoteNG** (Windows)
- **Royal TS/TSX** (Windows/macOS)
- **Remmina** (Linux)
- **FreeRDP** (Cross-platform)

## Security Best Practices

### File Permissions

Secure the configuration file:

```bash
sudo chown rdpgw:rdpgw /etc/rdpgw-auth.yaml
sudo chmod 600 /etc/rdpgw-auth.yaml
```

### Password Policy

- Use strong, unique passwords for each user
- Implement regular password rotation
- Avoid reusing passwords from other systems
- Consider minimum password length requirements

### Network Security

- Deploy gateway behind TLS termination
- Use private networks when possible
- Implement network-level access controls
- Monitor authentication logs for suspicious activity

### Access Control

- Limit user accounts to necessary personnel only
- Regularly audit user list and remove inactive accounts
- Use principle of least privilege
- Consider time-based access restrictions

## Migration Path

For production environments, consider migrating to more secure authentication methods:

### To OpenID Connect
- Better password security (hashed storage)
- MFA support
- Centralized user management
- SSO integration

### To Kerberos
- No password storage in gateway
- Enterprise authentication integration
- Stronger cryptographic security
- Seamless Windows domain integration

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Failed**: Verify username/password in configuration
2. **Helper Not Running**: Check if `rdpgw-auth` process is active
3. **Socket Errors**: Verify socket path and permissions

### Winbind Backend

With the winbind backend, rejected logons are logged as
`winbind: authentication rejected: <status>`, and helper failures as
`winbind: ntlm_auth reported a broken helper state: <reason>`. Output that
`ntlm_auth` writes to stderr is logged with the prefix `ntlm_auth: `.

| Log message | Likely cause |
|-------------|--------------|
| `NT_STATUS_WRONG_PASSWORD` | Wrong password. |
| `NT_STATUS_NO_SUCH_USER` | Unknown account, or wrong domain in the user name. |
| `NT_STATUS_ACCOUNT_DISABLED` | The account is disabled in Active Directory. |
| `NT_STATUS_ACCOUNT_LOCKED_OUT` | The account is locked out by the domain's lockout policy. |
| `NT_STATUS_PASSWORD_EXPIRED`, `NT_STATUS_PASSWORD_MUST_CHANGE` | The password must be changed first, e.g. by logging on to a domain workstation. |
| `NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED` | The user is not a member of `RequireMembershipOf`. |
| `broken helper state` (`BH`) | `winbindd` is not running, the trust is broken (`wbinfo -t` fails), or the helper user cannot access `/var/lib/samba/winbindd_privileged`. |
| `ntlm_auth did not answer within` | The domain controller is unreachable or slow. Check `wbinfo -P` and network access, or raise `Timeout`. |
| `NtlmAuthPath ... is not usable` at startup | `ntlm_auth` is not installed at the configured path. |

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check helper process
ps aux | grep rdpgw-auth

# Verify configuration
cat /etc/rdpgw-auth.yaml

# Test socket connectivity
ls -la /tmp/rdpgw-auth.sock

# Monitor authentication logs
journalctl -u rdpgw-auth -f
```

### Log Analysis

Enable debug logging in `rdpgw-auth` for detailed NTLM protocol analysis:

```bash
./rdpgw-auth -c /etc/rdpgw-auth.yaml -s /tmp/rdpgw-auth.sock -v
```

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements for NTLM authentication:

- **Database Backend**: Support for SQLite/PostgreSQL user storage
- **Password Hashing**: Secure password storage options
- **Audit Logging**: Enhanced security monitoring
